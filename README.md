# Parse Wikipedia Tables

This is a simple example of parsing data from a Wikipedia table (Top US Cities by Population). The code uses a fantastic library called "Selectolax" which is faster than Beautiful Soup.

This example is very basic but should give some background on how to parse data for other Wikipedia tables.

You may need to install the selectolax Python module. (pip install selectolax / pip3 install selectolax)
